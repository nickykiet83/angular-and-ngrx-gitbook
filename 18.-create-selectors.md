  of getting your NgRx architecture right.

# 18. Create selectors

## 1. Add selector file for spinner state

Selectors are methods used for obtaining slices of store state. @ngrx/store provides a few helper functions for optimising this selection.  Selectors are a big deal to help get your architecture right and you can read more in the docs here [https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/docs/store/selectors.md](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/docs/store/selectors.md).

When using the `createSelector` and `createFeatureSelector`functions @ngrx/store keeps track of the latest arguments in which your selector function was invoked. Because selectors are [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), the last result can be returned when the arguments match without re-invoking your selector function. This can provide performance benefits, particularly with selectors that perform expensive computation. This practice is known as [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization).

* Make a spinner.selectors.ts file.
* Make a `getSpinnerState` using `createFeatureSelector`, we can do this for other different feature state making it possible to join state slices together.
* Make a `getSpinner` selector using the `createSelector` method to return just the boolean value of the `isOn` property.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="src/app/state/spinner/spinner.selectors.ts" %}
```typescript
import { createFeatureSelector, createSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
import { State } from './spinner.reducer';

export const getSpinnerState = createFeatureSelector<State>('spinner');

export const getSpinner = createSelector(
  getSpinnerState,
  (state: State) => state.isOn
);

```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## 2. Use the new selector in our EventComponent

It is possible to see in this step how selectors clean our u=our code and make it easier for other developer son our team to know what they can get from the store. 

* Use the getSpinner selector versus our inline function where we "dot" into the property on the state tree we want.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="src/app/event/container/event/event.component.ts" %}
```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { Store, select } from '@ngrx/store';

import { Attendee } from '../../../models';
import { EventService } from '../../services/event.service';
import { State } from '../../../state/state';
import { StartSpinner, StopSpinner } from '../../../state/spinner/spinner.actions';
import { getSpinner } from '../../../state/spinner/spinner.selectors';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-event',
  templateUrl: './event.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./event.component.scss']
})
export class EventComponent implements OnInit {
  spinner$: Observable<boolean>;
  attendees$: Observable<Attendee[]>;

  constructor(
    private store: Store<State>,
    private eventService: EventService
  ) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.getAttendees();
    this.spinner$ = this.store.pipe(select(getSpinner));
  }
